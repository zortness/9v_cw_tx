# 9V QRP Micro Transciever

Based on the schematic and work of Jeff Anderson, [K6JCA](https://www.qrz.com/db/k6jca)
and [this blog post](http://k6jca.blogspot.com/2009/08/9v-qrp-transceiver.html).

Thank you to Jeff for your help in debugging my implementation of your design.

## Notes

This is still a work in progress. The prototype I have made so far using a proto board
is extremely sensitive and does not behave as originally intended, but it does transmit
and receive.

I will update here with real photos of the prototypes and actual SMD versions as I build them.


I have devided up the functionality across two small PCBs and used a 6-pin jumper between them.
This gives a bit more room to spread out the components, and hopefully avoid unwanted interactions.
It should also give a bit larger ground plane, which should help with environmental sensitivity.

## ProtoBoard Prototype

This prototype is extremely sensitive to capacitance (even touch), and lacks a true ground plane,
though I added through-hole-pins to act as grounding feet on my steel work table.
